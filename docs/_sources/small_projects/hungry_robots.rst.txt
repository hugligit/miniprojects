Hungry Robots
*************


.. tags:: large, game



You are trapped in a maze with hungry robots! You don’t know why robots need to
eat, but you don’t want to find out. The robots are badly programmed and will
move directly toward you, even if blocked by walls. You must trick the robots
into crashing into each other (or dead robots) without being caught.
