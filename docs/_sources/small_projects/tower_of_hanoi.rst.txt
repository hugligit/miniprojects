The Tower of Hanoi is a stack-moving puzzle game that features three poles on
which you can stack various-sized disks. The object of the game is to move one
tower of disks to another pole. However, only one disk can be moved at a time,
and larger disks cannot be placed on top of smaller ones. Figuring out a
certain pattern will help you solve this puzzle. Can you discover it? (Hint:
Try setting the TOTAL_DISKS variable to 3 or 4 to solve an easier version
first.)
