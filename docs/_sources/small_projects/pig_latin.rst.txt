Pig Latin

.. tags:: short, word



Pig Latin is a word game that transforms English words into a parody of Latin.
In Pig Latin, if a word begins with a consonant, the speaker removes this
letter and puts it at the end, followed by “ay.” For example, “pig” becomes
“igpay” and “latin” becomes “atinlay.” Otherwise, if the word begins with a
vowel, the speaker simply adds “yay” to the end of it. For example, “elephant”
becomes “elephantyay” and “umbrella” becomes “umbrellayay.”
