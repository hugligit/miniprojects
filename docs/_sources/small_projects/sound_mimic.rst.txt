Similar to the Simon electronic toy, this memorization game uses the
third-party playsound module to play four different sounds, which correspond to
the A, S, D, and F keys on the keyboard. As you successfully repeat the pattern
the game gives you, the patterns get longer and longer. How many sounds can you
hold in your short-term memory?

If you look at the code, youâ€™ll see that the playsound.playsound() function is
passed the filename of the sound to play. You can download the sound files from
these URLs:

https://inventwithpython.com/soundA.wav

https://inventwithpython.com/soundS.wav

https://inventwithpython.com/soundD.wav

https://inventwithpython.com/soundF.wav

Place these files in the same folder as soundmimic.py before running the
program. More information about the playsound module can be found at
https://pypi.org/project/playsound/. Users on macOS must also install the
pyobjc module from https://pypi.org/project/pyobjc/ for playsound to work.
