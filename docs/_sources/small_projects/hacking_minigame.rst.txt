Hacking Minigame

.. tags:: large, artistic, game, puzzle


In this game, the player must hack a computer by guessing a seven-letter
word used as the secret password. The computer’s memory banks display the
possible words, and the player is given hints as to how close each guess
was. For example, if the secret password is MONITOR but the player guessed
CONTAIN, they are given the hint that two out of seven letters were correct,
because both MONITOR and CONTAIN have the letter O and N as their second and
third letter. This game is similar to Project 1, “Bagels,” and the hacking
minigame in the Fallout series of video games.
