Water Bucket Puzzle

.. tags:: large, game, math, puzzle



In this solitaire puzzle game, you must use three buckets (three-liter,
five-liter, and eight-liter buckets) to collect exactly four liters of water in
one of the buckets. Buckets can only be emptied, completely filled, or poured
into another bucket. For example, you can fill the five-liter bucket and then
pour its contents into the three-liter bucket, leaving you with a full
three-liter bucket and two liters of water in the five-liter bucket.

With some effort, you should be able to solve the puzzle. But can you figure
out how to solve it with the minimal number of moves?
