Twenty Forty Eight

Gabriele Cirulli, a web developer, invented the game 2048 in one weekend. It
was inspired by Veewo Studios’ 1024 game, which in turn was inspired by
Threes!, a game by the development team Sirvo. In 2048, you must merge numbers
on a 4 × 4 board to clear them from the screen. Two 2s merge into a 4, two 4s
merge into an 8, and so on. The game adds a new 2 to the board on each merging.
The objective is to reach 2048 before the entire board fills up.
