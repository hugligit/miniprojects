Snail Race

.. tags:: short, artistic, beginner, game, multiplayer



You wonâ€™t be able to handle the fast-paced excitement of these racing . . .
snails. But what they lack in speed they make up for in ASCII-art cuteness.
Each snail (represented by an @ character for the shell and v for the two
eyestalks) moves slowly but surely toward the finish line. Up to eight snails,
each with a custom name, can race each other, leaving a slime trail in their
wake. This program is good for beginners.
