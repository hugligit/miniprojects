Sliding Tile Puzzle
*******************


.. tags:: large, game, puzzle


This classic puzzle relies on a 4 × 4 board with 15 numbered tiles and one free
space. The objective is to slide the tiles until the numbers are in the correct
order, going left to right and top to bottom. Tiles can only slide; you’re not
allowed to directly pick them up and rearrange them. Some versions of this
puzzle toy feature scrambled images that form a complete picture once solved.
