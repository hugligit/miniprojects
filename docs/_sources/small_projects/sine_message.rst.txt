Sine Message

.. tags:: tiny, artistic



This program displays a message of the user’s choice in a wavy pattern as the
text scrolls up. It accomplishes this effect with math.sin(), which implements
the trigonometric sine wave function. But even if you don’t understand the
math, this program is rather short and easy to copy.
