Text to Speech Talker
*********************


.. tags:: tiny, beginner



This program demonstrates the use of the pyttsx3 third-party module. Any
message you enter will be spoken out loud by your operating system’s
text-to-speech capabilities. Although computer-generated speech is an
incredibly complex branch of computer science, the pyttsx3 module provides an
easy interface for it, making this small program suitable for beginners. Once
you’ve learned how to use the module, you can add generated speech to your own
programs.

More information about the pyttsx3 module can be found at
https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/.
