This program mimics the “digital stream” visualization from the science
fiction movie The Matrix. Random beads of binary “rain” stream up from the
bottom of the screen, creating a cool, hacker-like visualization.
(Unfortunately, due to the way text moves as the screen scrolls down, it’s
not possible to make the streams fall downward without using a module such
as bext.)
