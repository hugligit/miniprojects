Rock Paper Scissors (Always Win Version)
****************************************


.. tags:: tiny, game, humour



This variant of Rock Paper Scissors is identical to Project 59, “Rock Paper
Scissors,” except the player will always win. The code selecting the computer’s
move is set so that it always chooses the losing move. You can offer this game
to your friends, who may be excited when they win . . . at first. See how long
it takes before they catch on to the fact that the game is rigged in their
favor.
