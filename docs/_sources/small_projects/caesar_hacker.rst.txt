Caesar Hacker

.. tags:: tiny, beginner, cryptography, math


This program can hack messages encrypted with the Caesar cipher from Project 6,
even if you donâ€™t know the key. There are only 26 possible keys for the Caesar
cipher, so a computer can easily try all possible decryptions and display the
results to the user. In cryptography, we call this technique a brute-force
attack.
