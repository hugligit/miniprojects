This program features a small algorithm for drawing ASCII-art diamonds of
various sizes. It contains functions for drawing either an outline or
filled-in-style diamond of the size you dictate. These functions are good
practice for a beginner; try to understand the pattern behind the diamond
drawings as they increase in size.
