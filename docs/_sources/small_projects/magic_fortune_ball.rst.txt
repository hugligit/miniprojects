Magic Fortune Ball
******************


.. tags:: tiny, beginner, humour


The Magic Fortune Ball can predict the future and answer your yes/no questions
with 100 percent accuracy using the power of Python’s random number module.
This program is similar to a Magic 8 Ball toy, except you don’t have to shake
it. It also features a function for slowly printing text strings with spaces in
between each character, giving the messages a spooky, mysterious effect.

Most of the code is dedicated to setting the eerie atmosphere. The program
itself simply selects a message to display in response to a random number.
