Carrot in a Box
***************


.. tags:: large, beginner, game, twoplayer



This is a simple and silly bluffing game for two human players. Each
player has a box. One box has a carrot in it, and each player wants to
have the carrot. The first player looks in their box and then tells the
second player they either do or donâ€™t have the carrot. The second player
gets to decide whether to swap boxes or not.
