“Ninety-Nine Bottles” is a folk song of undetermined origin known for its
length and repetitiveness. The lyrics go, “Ninety-nine bottles of milk on the
wall, ninety-nine bottles of milk. Take one down, pass it around, ninety-eight
bottles of milk on the wall.” As the lyrics repeat, the number of bottles falls
from ninety-eight to ninety-seven, then from ninety-seven to ninety-six, until
it reaches zero: “One bottle of milk on the wall, one bottle of milk. Take it
down, pass it around, no more bottles of milk on the wall!”

Luckily for us, computers are excellent at performing repetitive tasks, and
this program reproduces all of the lyrics programmatically. An extended version
of this program is in Project 51, “niNety-nniinE BoOttels.”
