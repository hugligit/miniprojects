Progress Bar

.. tags:: tiny, module


A progress bar is a visual element that shows how much of a task has been
completed. Progress bars are often used alongside downloading files or software
installations. This project creates a getProgressBar() function that returns a
progress bar string based on the arguments passed to it. It simulates a
downloading file, but you can reuse the progress bar code in your own projects.
