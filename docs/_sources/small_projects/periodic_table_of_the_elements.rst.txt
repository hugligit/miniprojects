Periodic Table of the Elements

.. tags:: short, science



The periodic table of the elements organizes all known chemical elements into a
single table. This program presents this table and lets the player access
additional information about each element, such as its atomic number, symbol,
melting point, and so on. I compiled this information from Wikipedia and stored
it in a file called periodictable.csv that you can download from
https://inventwithpython.com/periodictable.csv.
