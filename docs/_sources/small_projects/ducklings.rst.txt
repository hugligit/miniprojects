.. tags:: large, artistic, oop, scrolling



This program creates a scrolling field of ducklings. Each duckling has slight
variations: they can face left or right and have two different body sizes, four
types of eyes, two types of mouths, and three positions for their wings. This
gives us 96 different possible variations, which the Ducklings program produces
endlessly.kk
