Deoxyribonucleic acid is a tiny molecule that exists in every cell of our
bodies and contains the blueprint for how our bodies grow. It looks like
a double helix (a sort of twisted ladder) of pairs of nucleotide molecules:
guanine, cytosine, adenine, and thymine. These are represented by the
letters G, C, A, and T. DNA is a long molecule; itâ€™s microscopic, but if it
were stretched out, its 3 billion base pairs would be 2 meters long! This
program is a simple animation of DNA.
