Etching Drawer

.. tags:: large, artistic


When you move a pen point around the screen with the WASD keys, the etching
drawer forms a picture by tracing a continuous line, like the Etch A Sketch
toy. Let your artistic side break out and see what images you can create!
This program also lets you save your drawings to a text file so you can
print them out later. Plus, you can copy and paste the WASD movements of
other drawings into this program, like the WASD commands for the Hilbert
Curve fractal presented on lines 6 to 14 of the source code.
